The next step was to raise funds for implementation of the identified interventions through individuals, corporates & also leveraging government schemes such as Sujalam Sufalam.

,,419,SUSTAINABLE RURAL LIVELIHOOD FOR WOMEN THROUGH VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS USING COW DUNG,Submitted,"India is the world’s largest producer of cattle and the second-largest producer of milk after the United States. Tamil Nadu, being one of the leading states in livestock population and dairy farming, plays a significant role in this sector. The state’s rapid economic development policies have increasingly aimed to integrate rural populations, especially women, into sustainable livelihood opportunities.
In Sindalakarai Village Panchayat, located in Thoothukudi District with a geographical area of 1,044.82 hectares, a survey conducted by the participating institute recorded a population of 1,194, of which 635 are females. The female literacy rate is 58.43%.
Agriculture is the primary occupation for women, but it does not provide a steady, year-round income. Most men in the village migrate abroad for employment, leaving women to take responsibility for the household and small-scale farming.
The main livestock of the village includes hens, goats, and cows, with around 150 native cows. Each cow produces about 10 kg of dung daily, resulting in 1,500 kg of dung every day. At present, part of this dung is used as manure, while the rest is discarded along the roadsides as waste, causing sanitation and environmental issues.
This project is designed to empower rural women in Tamil Nadu by training them to convert cow dung into value-added products such as: Eco-friendly products (cow dung doop sticks, incense sticks,  and decorative items)
By developing entrepreneurial skills, women will be able to generate sustainable income throughout the year, reduce waste, improve village sanitation, and contribute to Tamil Nadu’s larger goals of women empowerment, rural development, and circular economy practices.",2024,"Seasonal Income Instability: Agriculture is the main occupation for women, but it does not provide year-round income.
Male Migration: Most men migrate abroad for work, leaving women with limited livelihood opportunities.

Lack of Awareness & Skills: Women lack training in value addition and entrepreneurship skills.
Financial Constraints: Limited access to seed capital, loans, or subsidies to start and sustain micro-enterprises.
Social & Cultural Barriers: Women face challenges in taking leadership roles due to traditional gender roles and limited decision-making power.
",,"Resource Utilization – Convert daily 1,500 kg of cow dung from native cows into value-added products instead of letting it go to waste.

Women Entrepreneurship – Build capacity of women SHGs through training in biogas production, organic manure preparation, and eco-product making.

Sustainable Livelihoods – Provide women with year-round income opportunities beyond seasonal agriculture.

Eco-Friendly Products – Produce biogas, organic fertilizers, vermicompost, cow dung logs, incense sticks, and decorative items.

Health & Sanitation – Reduce roadside waste dumping, improving hygiene and village cleanliness.

Market Linkages – Connect SHGs with local markets, cooperatives, and e-commerce platforms for sustainable sales.

Scalability & Replicability – Create a model that can be replicated across rural Tamil Nadu villages with minor adjustments.","This project transforms an abundant and underutilized local resource—cow dung—into sustainable income opportunities for rural women in Tamil Nadu. Unlike conventional agriculture, which is seasonal and uncertain, this model provides women with year-round entrepreneurial activity, enabling financial independence, improved sanitation, and environmental sustainability.

Empowers women to become self-reliant through skill development and income generation.

Turns waste into wealth by converting 1,500 kg of daily cow dung into marketable biogas, organic manure, and eco-products.

Improves rural sanitation by preventing the dumping of cow dung on roadsides.

Increased Household Income: Women earn up to ₹5,000 per month from sales, directly improving the financial stability of their families. Provides steady income beyond seasonal agriculture or MGNREGA jobs.
Leadership & Confidence: Women take up leadership roles in production units, decision-making, and training others, enhancing their social recognition. Personal testimonies show greater confidence, dignity, and independence in family and community life.

,,420,Mushroom Cultivation,Submitted,"Under the supervision of Prof. Vivek Kumar (CRDT, IIT Delhi), the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) team conducted a participatory rural exercise in 2017 in the Gaindikhata cluster of villages, Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Recognizing limited income opportunities for farmers between November and February, mushroom cultivation was introduced as a sustainable livelihood option.
With support from the local youth, district administration, and the Uttarakhand Food Processing Department, six farmers were trained in Dehradun. Using cleaned rooms in their homes, they began cultivation with compost, spawn, and poly bags provided through ONGC Foundation support. The initiative grew rapidly, engaging 12 more families, with mushrooms fetching up to ?250/kg in local markets.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, two local farmers established mushroom units in Laldhang and Pilli Padav villages, generating employment for 100 people and producing 1,500 kg of mushrooms daily by 2020. The success led the district administration to promote mushroom farming widely, and in 2021, mushroom was recognized as Haridwar’s """"One District One Product"""" (ODOP) by the Uttarakhand government.
This transformation was made possible through the collective efforts of UBA, ONGC Foundation, Surabhi Foundation, district officials, and the local community, making mushroom farming a source of income, employment, and nutrition in the region.
