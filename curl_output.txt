{"name":"Ground Water Level Measuring Device (GWLMD)","summary":"A low-cost, portable, electric switch-type device developed by RuTAG IIT Delhi for accurately measuring groundwater levels, primarily aimed at rural farmers and field agencies to improve water management practices.","detail":"The Ground Water Level Measuring Device (GWLMD) is an electric switch-type instrument designed by the Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) at IIT Delhi. It comprises a robust, rust-resistant stainless-steel probe, which is an assembly of a plumb bob, a perforated tubular body, a high-pressure cord holding gland, and copper electrodes. This probe is connected to a high-tension coaxial cable that is further linked to an electronic circuit consisting of a battery, an LED lamp, and a beeper. When the electrodes at the end of the probe come into contact with conductive fluid, such as groundwater, the circuit completes, triggering both a buzzing sound and the illumination of the LED. The depth to the groundwater is then accurately read from the markings on the cable. The device adheres to IS 15896:2011 standards and incorporates a light-weight aluminum casted cable spool for extended operational life and enhanced stability during use, attributed to the added mass of the plumb bob.","domain":"Water","benefit":"The GWLMD offers a significantly low-cost, robust, and accurate alternative to conventional, often expensive, and less reliable commercial water level measuring equipment. It addresses several critical shortcomings of older devices, such as susceptibility to false readings caused by moisture, fragility, and the tendency to get stuck within observation wells. By providing precise groundwater level data, the device empowers rural farmers and field agencies to effectively estimate groundwater resources, implement improved water management practices, facilitate sustainable water allocation and resource planning, and adapt to climate change impacts on water availability. Its design ensures portability and high operational stability, making it suitable for field use.","costAndEffort":"The tentative cost of the Ground Water Level Measuring Device is approximately ₹10,000. This price, however, does not include freight and installation charges. The device is designed to be accessible and easy to use for rural farmers, implying a low operational effort.","returnOnInvestment":"While a specific numerical ROI is not explicitly provided, the deployment of the GWLMD is expected to yield substantial returns through various benefits. These include improved efficiency in water management and resource planning, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices and reduced water wastage. Accurate groundwater monitoring can also help in adapting to climate change by enabling better assessment of impacts and development of mitigation strategies. For organizations and farmers, the low cost of the device compared to expensive commercial alternatives, coupled with its robust design that minimizes breakage and false readings, translates into long-term savings and more effective resource utilization. Improved data accuracy can also reduce costs associated with drilling misalignment in well installation, as observed with similar high-accuracy groundwater detectors.","status":"MATURE","launchYear":2017,"references":["https://rutag.iitd.ac.in/rutag/?q=ground-water-level-measuring-device"],"targetBeneficiaries":["rural farmers","field agencies","Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) involved in water management","Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India","communities in Ghana","communities in Namibia","communities in Sudan","communities in Zambia"]}
